description: "<p>\r\n  Interest and impact are two of the key aspects of your project that you should\r\n  consider as you design your public involvement plan. In general, the higher\r\n  the level of public interest and the larger the impact of your project, the\r\n  more robust your public involvement process should be. At the same time, there\r\n  may be cases where the interest in your project or issue is low, but you need\r\n  it to be higher. In this case, you may need to integrate tools such as social\r\n  media campaigns that can help you generate public interest. We have created a\r\n  public involvement spectrum infographic. It matches public involvement tools\r\n  to different levels of public involvement and different levels of interest and\r\n  impact. You should use the infographic as a prompt to determine what tools are\r\n  appropriate for your project.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  To determine the level of interest, it is helpful to conduct a stakeholder\r\n  analysis. Tools to assist in the stakeholder analysis include:\r\n  <a\r\n    href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17evXe5di1k9KrOimJkPHgfn-5bBqgbeglmDGBN5FigY/edit?usp=sharing\"\r\n    >Stakeholder Analysis Worksheet</a\r\n  >. In general, you want to determine who the main stakeholders for your\r\n  project are. It is also important to determine how organized your stakeholders\r\n  are. For example, are they represented by a neighborhood committee or an\r\n  industry organization? Organized stakeholders will be in a better position to\r\n  express their perspective on your project. As a result, they may need more\r\n  attention in your public involvement plan. There also may be stakeholders who\r\n  you need to hear from, but who have traditionally not been at the table when\r\n  it comes to working with PBOT. If this is true, you will need to build in\r\n  special tools, such as focus groups or other specialized outreach, to bring\r\n  these groups into the conversation. Finally, as you are determining the level\r\n  of interest, you should research whether there is an existing level of\r\n  controversy or public conflict about the issue your project addresses. The\r\n  Public Involvement Staff Directory is an important tool as you are trying to\r\n  gauge the level of interest. It will help you identify PBOT staffers who may\r\n  be familiar with the stakeholders that you will be working with and who can\r\n  provide advice and guidance.\r\n</p>"
