description: "<p>\r\n  Achieving equity is a key goal for both PBOT and the Portland city government\r\n  as a whole. In terms of public involvement this specifically means\r\n  strengthening outreach and public engagement for communities of color,\r\n  immigrant and refugee communities and other groups that have been\r\n  traditionally underrepresented in our public involvement activities, including\r\n  people with disabilities and people from low-income households. The goal of\r\n  such equitable public involvement is to ensure our projects, programs and\r\n  policies fairly address the needs and concerns of these communities. As you\r\n  plan your public involvement process, you should pay special attention to how\r\n  you will engage traditionally underrepresented communities. To help inform\r\n  your process design in this respect, we recommend considering the following\r\n  six elements:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Build personal relationships with target population.</strong> To do\r\n    this, you should identify key constituents that PBOT either has a\r\n    relationship with or should be building a relationship with. You should\r\n    consider events to attend or venues to visit where you can identify natural\r\n    community leaders.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Create a welcoming atmosphere</strong>. To determine whether your\r\n    proposed process achieves this, ask yourself if your process reflects,\r\n    honors and welcomes the community and if the venues for your events are\r\n    invite participation and engagement.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Increase accessibility</strong>. It is important to eliminate or\r\n    minimize barriers to participation such as language, childcare, food, time\r\n    of day and transportation.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Develop alternative methods for engagement.</strong> To encourage\r\n    participation, it may be necessary to adopt non-traditional methods of\r\n    outreach. Please see the case studies in the resource center for ideas about\r\n    how to engage communities beyond the usual public involvement methods.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Maintain a presence within the community</strong>. You will receive\r\n    better input if you demonstrate to the communities that historically have\r\n    not been at the table that your are committed to building a strong,\r\n    respectful relationship. You should consider having a presence at community\r\n    events. It is also valuable to establish places in the community where\r\n    people can have sustained, informal interactions with you.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><strong>Partner with diverse organizations and agencies.</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Equity and Inclusion section on our internal website also has some very\r\n  good resources that can be helpful as you work on this section of your plan.\r\n  This\r\n  <a\r\n    href=\"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/seattles-dot-is-rethinking-transportation-equity?utm_source=Next+City+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=c2da212dc2-Daily_790&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_fcee5bf7a0-c2da212dc2-44154329\"\r\n    >article</a\r\n  >\r\n  explores the approach to equitable public involvement and outcomes at Seattle\r\n  DOT.\r\n</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n  Based on the stakeholders identified and the appropriate level of public\r\n  involvement, select tools that will best inform the community and facilitate\r\n  an appropriate level of involvement.
