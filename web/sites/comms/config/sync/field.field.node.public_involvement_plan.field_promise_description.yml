description: "<p>What is the promise to the public? If there are multiple, for different stakeholders, why?</p>\r\n<p>Be very clear about the level of public input you are promising your constituents. Members of the public get rightly frustrated when a public process promises a specific level of public input, but then delivers something different. It is important to be transparent and authentic with your constituents. Respect their time and do not over-promise.</p>"
