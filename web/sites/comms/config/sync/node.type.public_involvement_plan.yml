help: "Creating an effective public involvement plan is a critical step in any effective public involvement process. It does require a certain level of investment in terms of time and research at the beginning of the process. But this investment is more than worth it. By taking the time to do such things as clearly articulating the goals of your public involvement process, identifying key stakeholders and matching public involvement activities to the level of input you need, you can help insure that you receive high quality input that meets the needs of your project or program. \r\n\r\nThe guidelines linked at the top of this window will help you as your gather information and ideas for each of the public involvement plan's section. As you are working on the template, please don't forget to take advantage of the other tools and resources available in the PBOT Public Involvement Resource Center. If you have any questions, please contact John Brady or Irene Schwoeffermann. "
